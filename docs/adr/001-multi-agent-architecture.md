# ADR-001: Multi-Agent Architecture Pattern

## Status
**Accepted** - 2024-01-15

## Context
The AI Architecture Demo needs to process documents through multiple specialized AI capabilities including analysis, business intelligence, and quality assurance. We need to decide on the architectural pattern for organizing these AI capabilities.

## Decision
We will implement a **multi-agent architecture** with specialized AI agents coordinated by a central orchestrator.

## Rationale

### Advantages
1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each agent has a specific responsibility and expertise area
2. **Scalability**: Individual agents can be scaled independently based on workload
3. **Maintainability**: Easier to update, test, and debug individual agents
4. **Extensibility**: New agents can be added without modifying existing ones
5. **Fault Isolation**: Failure in one agent doesn't affect others

### Implementation Details
- **DocumentAnalyzerAgent**: Text extraction, entity recognition, classification
- **BusinessIntelligenceAgent**: Analytics, insights, reporting
- **QualityAssuranceAgent**: Validation, quality scoring, compliance
- **AgentOrchestrator**: Task routing, coordination, status management

### Communication Pattern
- Event-driven communication via Kafka
- Async task processing with status tracking
- RESTful API for external interactions

## Consequences

### Positive
- Clear separation of AI capabilities
- Horizontal scaling capabilities
- Independent development and deployment
- Better testability and debugging

### Negative
- Increased complexity in orchestration
- Network communication overhead
- More complex monitoring and debugging across agents

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Monolithic AI Service**: Single service handling all AI tasks
   - Rejected due to scaling limitations and maintenance complexity

2. **Pipeline Architecture**: Sequential processing chain
   - Rejected due to lack of flexibility and parallel processing capabilities

3. **Microservices without Agents**: Traditional microservices approach
   - Rejected as it doesn't capture the autonomous, intelligent behavior we need

## Implementation Notes
- Use async/await patterns for non-blocking operations
- Implement circuit breakers for fault tolerance
- Add comprehensive monitoring and logging
- Use event sourcing for audit trails
