# Security Guide

This directory contains security implementation details, best practices, and compliance guidelines for the AI Architecture Demo platform.

## Security Overview

The AI Architecture Demo implements comprehensive security measures across all layers:

- **Authentication & Authorization**: JWT tokens with role-based access control
- **Data Encryption**: TLS 1.3 in transit, AES-256 at rest
- **Container Security**: Non-root users, minimal attack surface
- **Network Security**: Service mesh, network segmentation
- **Secrets Management**: Encrypted secrets with rotation policies

## Security Best Practices

### Development Security
1. **Secure Coding**: Follow OWASP secure coding guidelines
2. **Code Reviews**: Mandatory security-focused code reviews
3. **Static Analysis**: Automated SAST scanning in CI/CD
4. **Dependency Scanning**: Regular dependency vulnerability checks
5. **Secret Detection**: Prevent secrets in code repositories

### Deployment Security
1. **Immutable Infrastructure**: Infrastructure as Code with version control
2. **Least Privilege**: Minimal permissions for all services and users
3. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
4. **Security Automation**: Automated security testing and deployment
5. **Incident Response**: Prepared response procedures and runbooks

### Operational Security
1. **Continuous Monitoring**: 24/7 security monitoring and alerting
2. **Regular Assessments**: Quarterly security assessments and penetration testing
3. **Access Reviews**: Regular review of user access and permissions
4. **Security Training**: Ongoing security awareness training
5. **Compliance Audits**: Regular compliance validation and reporting
